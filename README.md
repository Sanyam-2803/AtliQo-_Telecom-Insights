📝 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 

- AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.However,the management noticed a 
  decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022
- AtliQo’s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch
- The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active 
  user rate and other key metrics
- They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active users.  Peter Pandey, a junior data analyst, is assigned to this task

📋 𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸

- Imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and perform the following task: 
- Create the comparison report based on the mock-up provided. Please note the mock-up is created by a business user who has minimal idea about dashboarding. Hence, 
  you need to represent the insights in a much better way
- The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand
- Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard to support the cause

📊 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬

- Amongst all cities, Pune city witnessed highest Average revenue per user(ARPU) loss of 13% followed by Chennai (2.5%) after launch of 5G services in the May 
  2022.Thus company could strategically increase pricing plans without losing user base in such cities

- Top 5 cities on the basis of highest loss in Monthly active users(MAU) after launch of 5G services were Ahmedabad(18.93%) followed by Delhi 
  (17.63%),Raipur(16.67%),Patna(16.11%) & Mumbai(14.35%).Company should try to focus on improving network quality, customer service, might offer better lucrative

- Overall AtliQo experienced an increase in avg revenue per users (ARPU)after launch of 5G network which is a good indicator for company profitability
- AtliQo experienced loss in Monthly active subscriber base after the launch of 5G services which is not a good sign since cost associated with acquiring new 
  customers is often higher than retention costs. To increase customer retention Company could offerdiscounts to loyal customers such as discounted deals
- AtliQo Top 5 plan revenue generators were P1 followed by P2, P3, P4 & P11 respectively
- Plan P10 generated the lowest revenue among all the plans of AtliQo
- Among top 5 plans of AtliQo ,Mumbai city generated highest revenue contribution while Chennai had least
- Plan P1 performed exceptionally well even after 5G whereas plans P2 & P3 had minimal effect after 5G
- Plans P11 & P12 which are introduced later after 5G are performing well. Thus it is evident that customers first choice are combo plans having higher data usage 
  limit with validity
- Plans P5,P6 & P7 had huge dip in performance after 5G while P9 & P10 have been discontinued after 5G
- AtliQo ranked at 3rd position in Market share with 19.56 %  whereas PIO ranked at 1st position followed by Britel
- PIO operator remained at TOP in market share with more than 35% across all cities while AtliQo ranked at 3rd position.Thus AtliQo marketing team should strategize 
  to increase market share
- After the launch of 5G in May-22, AtliQo lost market share while other competitors such as PIO , Britel ,DADAFONE & others gained .Steps such as reducing plan 
  prices or strategic acquisitions could be done to gain market share
